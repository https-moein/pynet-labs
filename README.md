## ðŸ“š About

This repository contains **practice scripts** created during my journey into computer networking and Blue Team fundamentals using Python.

These scripts are **educational**, not production-ready. They help me (and maybe you) understand:

- how networking works under the hood  
- how to write tools using only Python's standard library  
- how to get better, one packet at a time

## ðŸ”§ Topics Covered

- DNS resolving
- IP address lookup
- Using the `socket` module
- Basic error handling (e.g., `gaierror`, `herror`)
- CLI-friendly patterns for scripting
